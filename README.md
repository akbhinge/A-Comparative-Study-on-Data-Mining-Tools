# A-Comparative-Study-on-Data-Mining-Tools
Learning data mining tools made easy!

- Data Mining Tools Implemented in the case study-
- Rapid Miner
- Weka
- Tableau

- Technologies used to design web interface-
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- JQuery
- Javascript
- Highslide.JS

--

- This comparative study presents a detailed analysis of working of various data mining tools and provides steps to implement various classification and clustering algorithms
- Data Mining Tools considered in the comparative Study-
- 1. Rapid Miner
- 2. Weka
- 3. Tableau - a useful data visualization tool!
- 4. R - useful resources provided to learn implementation in R
- A number of useful resources provided to understand the concepts of data mining
- Step by Step implementation of Classification and Clustering algorithms 
- Quiz to understand the working features of each of these data mining tools
- K-Means clustering and Naive Bayes Algorithm implementation provided for sample explaination
- Used Highslide.JS to enable easier visualization of implementation screenshots
- A site map to facilitate easier navigation to useful information of each tool

--
Future Scope-
- Use d3.js to create visualizations of implementations of various tools.
- Include implementation of more data mining tools in the case study/web interface.
- Include complex examples in the comparative study
- Create a new tab consisting of frequently asked questions to the comparative study based on the feedback from the students and online research
- Re-arrange the files to make the directories look more ordered
